# Php-MySql-CMS
Dynamic, MySql database driven CMS webapp, written in Php, JavaScript, jQuery, Html5 and CSS3. Utilizes Grunt build system. Intended to be packaged for mobile with jQuery Mobile and Cordova PhoneGap(I may go native with it later on android and iOS with Java(ugh) and ObjectiveC(urgh) or Swift). 

For the initial test run, I will design with a Sci-Fi/Fantasy (Star Trek, Star Wars, LOTR, D&D, etc.) random jokes application and database. I may also redesign as a SPA with NodeJS and AngularJS, BackboneJS, EmberJS or some other JavaScript front-end framework or Ruby on Rails.
